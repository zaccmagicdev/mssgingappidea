### MESSAGING APP

This is a concept for a private messaging app that I am currently working on for the sake of wanting to expand my knowledge on
react and to sharpen my very rusty backend skills...a first release should be expected around the end of August 2024 - early September

### UPDATE
Took a little hiatus from this project because I was stuck on deciding on a backend and life in general...but it has been
recently decided that I will be using firebase for the backend and making sure it is secure with more research. The simplicity
and real-time features will be instrumental for making a backend as well as the easy to implement authorization.

# Will Feature
- A full and free private messaging system with the ability to play games in chat and is totally customizable
- Will also work in groups for games and messaging
- Will have a custom newsfeed for the user
- Everything is encrypted and private
